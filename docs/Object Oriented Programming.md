# Object Oriented Programming

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a style of programming adopted by many programming languages (e.g. C++,Java, Python) and allows the developers to define a user defined data type known as a class. A user may create instances of these classes, known as objects, and use them to store and manipulate data. The contents of the class will define the data that is stored in instances of the class in member variables, and functions known as methods which can access, manipulate, and perform calculations on the data.

The complexity of a class can be very simple, such as a variable type (i.e. integer, double, array etc.) or very complicated, such as a solver for complex non-linear problems. Every class comprises several components which are the members, the methods, the constructors and the destructor. In order to better explain the use of objects in a code we are going to use as an example the implementation of a class that would manifest complex numbers in a code.

## Members

A class requires the definition of its members which are variables that are necessary for the specific functionality that we want to add in the code. By taking the complex number example, we would definitely require two variables (one for the real part and one for the imaginary part) in order to properly represent the number.
