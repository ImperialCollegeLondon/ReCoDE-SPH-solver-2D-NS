# Object Oriented Programming

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a stlye of programming adopted by many programming languages (e.g. C++,Java) and allows the developers to create groups of variables (members) and functions (methods) which are related to each other based on the functionality they add in the code. These groups are called objects or classes. The complexity of a class spans across a very wide range and can take the form of a variable type (i.e. integer, double, array etc.) or (for example) a solver for complex non-linear problems. Every class comprises of several components which are the members, the methods, the constructors and the destructor. In order to better explain the use of objects in a code we are going to use as an example the implementation of a class that would manifest complex numbers in a code.

## Members

A class requires the definition of its members which are variables that are necessary for the specific functionality that we want to add in the code. By taking the complex number example, we would definately require two variables (one for the real part and one for the imaginary part) in order to properly represent the number.
