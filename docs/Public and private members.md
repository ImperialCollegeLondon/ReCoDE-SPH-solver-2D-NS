# Private and public members

Initially it can be seen that the use of private and public members was wrong. Actually what was implemented is the exact opposite compared to what is considered to be the best practice. More specifically, all the members which are modified solely by the class methods were declared as public which means that they could be accessed even from the main program and modified directly. In general it is a good practice to declare as private all the class members to avoid any unwanted or unintended change outside the class methods by the developer. This may be considered to be redundant for simple cases, but in very large projects which contain hundreds of files, a small unintended mistake can cause serious problems.

Furthermore, it can be seen that it was required in the main program to modify dt, T and h. In order to achieve that, the original code made use of what is called "operator overloading". Although this may be useful in some cases (e.g. to define the multiplication between classes which represent complex numbers) in this case this is was not the best practice. One way around that would be to declare these variables as public and modify them directly from the main program. However, as it was stated earlier this is not a good practice and this where the "setter" functions come into play. These are basically methods of the class which have access to the class members and are called when the private members need to be modified.
