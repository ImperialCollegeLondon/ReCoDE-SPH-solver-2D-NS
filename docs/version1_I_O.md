# Description of the code

## Overview

The material in `v1` comprises an extension of `v0` where an improved process for handling the input and output (I/O) procedures in the code is implemented. We start by removing the hard-coded values from the code and replacing them with data read from input files in order to make the parameters more easy to change and therefore to make the code design for general purposes (different domain boundaries and fluid parameters).
