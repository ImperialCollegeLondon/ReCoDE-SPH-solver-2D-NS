# Adaptive timestep

When performing numerical integration, the choice of the timestep depends on the parameters of the problem and the numerical scheme which was chosen to discretise the equations. A wrong choice can result to numerical instabilities and ultimately to an unphysical solution which could possibly cause our program to crash. In CFD to avoid such incidences we make use of the so called CFL criterion, which ensures that the numerical speed of propagation is smaller than the one which characterises the physical problem, and no information is lost during any timestep. ÎŸne way of ensuring stability of numerical computations is to predefine a timestep which we know that is small enough to always satisfy the CFL criterion. However, in that case, we may over-resolve our problem in time and perform unnecessary computations, since the timestep would have been chosen to capture all the ranges of timescales that may appear during the simulation, thus result in excessive and unnecessary computations which overally increase the CPU time of our program.
